Upgrade Ideas
	Some are wave based, some are army based, others are entirely random and 
cummulative. The idea is to give the player random options so they hope to get 
a specific upgrade for their build idea. So I will need to set it up to where 
there are a few build options.

Build Ideas:
	Humans
		Machine Gunners
		Hulking Swordsmen
		Jedi
		Commander Commander?
	Elves
		Ninjas
		Tower Healer
		Snipers
		Elemental Troops
		Undead Army
	Dwarves
		Hulkbuster/Actual Tank
		Thor Odinson
		No Cost Troops?

Non Build Related Upgrades:
	Economy Upgrades
	TowerHP
	No Housing Commander
	Melee/Ranged/Support/Special general upgrades
		Speed/Damage/Range/...
	
	
Now, when and how does the player get more Commanders?
	Rewarded on completion of specific waves
	Part of the random choices with their chances being low or restricted
	Instead of Rewarded, rather unlock another for purchase. High Price?
	Part of the Player's choices when choosing their "class"?
